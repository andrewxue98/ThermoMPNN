Changes made to make ThermoMPNN pip installable (September 25, 2025)

1. Created Package Structure
   - Created thermompnn/ directory as the main package
   - Moved core Python files into the package:
     * protein_mpnn_utils.py
     * model_utils.py
     * datasets.py
     * cache.py
     * train_thermompnn.py
     * transfer_model.py
   - Moved analysis/ directory into the package
   - Added __init__.py files to make directories proper Python packages

2. Added Package Configuration Files
   - Created setup.py with package metadata and dependencies
   - Created pyproject.toml for modern Python packaging
   - Created MANIFEST.in to include non-Python files
   - Updated package data configuration to include model weights and configs

3. Updated Import Statements
   - Modified relative imports in all Python files
   - Updated analysis module imports to use proper package paths
   - Removed sys.path modifications in favor of proper Python packaging

4. Removed Unnecessary Files
   - Removed environment.yaml as it's replaced by pip dependencies
   - Kept config.yaml and local.yaml for configuration

5. Updated Documentation
   - Added pip installation instructions to README.md
   - Added three installation options:
     a. Direct installation from GitHub
     b. Manual installation from source
     c. Conda/Mamba environment setup (legacy)
   - Preserved all existing documentation and instructions

Note: No functional changes were made to the codebase. All modifications were purely for packaging and distribution purposes.
